Replacing old mdp entry 'nstxtcout' by 'nstxout-compressed'
Replacing old mdp entry 'xtc_grps' by 'compressed-x-grps'

NOTE 1 [file ./NPT_Berendsen.mdp]:
  Setting nstcalcenergy (100) equal to nstenergy (50)


NOTE 2 [file ./NPT_Berendsen.mdp]:
  leapfrog does not yet support Nose-Hoover chains, nhchainlength reset to 1


WARNING 1 [file ./NPT_Berendsen.mdp]:
  Using Berendsen pressure coupling invalidates the true ensemble for the
  thermostat

Analysing residue names:
There are:    18      Other residues
Analysing residues not classified as Protein/DNA/RNA/Water and splitting into groups...
Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 450 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
This run will generate roughly 1 Mb of data
