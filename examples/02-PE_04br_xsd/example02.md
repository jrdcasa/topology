### Example 2: Create a topology from a xsd file
________________

The file `01-Min_frame_001.xsd` was created using the Amorphous Builder tool in Materials Studio 2021. This structure was also minimized using the COMPASSIII force field.

The system contains 10 chains of C300 with four butyl branches uniformily distributed along the backbone chain. 

This example reads the xsd file and then write xyz, gro and pdb files.
