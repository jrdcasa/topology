### Example 3: Create a topology from a xsd file containing a polymer blends
________________

The file `blend.xsd` was created using the Amorphous Builder tool in Materials Studio 2021. This structure was also minimized using the COMPASSIII force field.

The system contains 5 chains (3Ch of PE-linear (C6) and 2Ch of EVA-copoloymer)

This example reads the xsd file and then write xyz, gro and pdb files.
