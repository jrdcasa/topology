        This program processes a set of PDB files, typically generated 
        by Materials Studio, representing a molecular trajectory and 
        converts them into GRO and XTC formats compatible with GROMACS.

    The PDB file must contain the atom type in the atom name field and 
    the residue name in the residue name field. Once the PDB has been generated, 
    it must be properly formatted to ensure compatibility. 
    In particular, each atom type must match a valid atom type 
    defined in the force field being used.
    It is essential to verify that the file is correctly formatted prior to use.
